# CSS Diner

> Harry D: use familiar pictures of food (burger, sandwich nesting stuff)
 
> Harry D: use pictures instead of abstract shapes (apple is just a circle, looks like a clip-art)  

> Joe: pickle looks like a pill. Make it lumpy 

> Joe: add sound effects (eg bing for right, trumpet at the end, duck noise for error)

> Tom: being able to go back and see what you wrote in the previous levels

> Aidan: examples on the right are not easily related to the images on the left. Provide more examples, Explain what the orange is (element)

> Joe: maybe first level should be super-easy, just type in this `plate` to get familiar with the interface

> Tom: wtf is bento?

> Joe: type in properties as well, for example *Paint the thing blue*, *Put the plate back in the cupboard*
