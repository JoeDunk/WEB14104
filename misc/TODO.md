# Term 3

It's not enough to coast along and settle on the first (or second) design.

I believe that you can all do better and I want to help you improve. 

I don't want to be marking work that it's just *ok*. 

So far we've been quite gentle at you but we're going to accelerate and it's going to get harder.

You need to work harder and challenge yourselves.

You're paying a lot to be here. Imagine yourself in a few years time, looking back at what you have done (or not) at uni. 

Now it's your opportunity to experiment, to explore and soak up all the knowledge and skills from all the people that are around you here.


### Computational thinking 

Teaching computers how to play by your rules?


## Demos

* How to create a mobile-friendly navigation (with hamburger button) (see http://adventure.com)
* How to make a fixed footer (again, see http://adventure.com)

## FTP and hosting

* Doug's guide on hosting stuff on GitHub (via GitHub pages) http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2015/01/04/github-pages

## POP

## JS

* Demo how to build the [Student Shuffler](../resources/html5-boilerplate-student-shuffler)?

* [Eloquent JavaScript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aa2-HtUglQrAps31s4LdTPVsiFb1BxhyjZolxeezzcI/preview?sle=true)

* [jQuery quiz](http://tonyfreed.com/blog/top_jquery_interview_question_2015#sthash.utx9nyaD.dpbs) (it's actually meant to be interview questions but can be repurposed)

* [JS design patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) by Addy Osmani

## WP

From Gutenberg (printing revolution) to Zuckerberg (social media "revolution"), passing by WordPress (blogging revolution: everyone can be a publisher)

Jargon Buster: API, SPA, REST...

SPA (Single Page Application) vs page reload: Using the API has a performance benefit: static HTML pages with JS to fetch the data is a thing! No PHP dependency.

* http://www.wpbeginner.com/ any good?

WordPress is one of the best platforms out there for creating a website. It's super awesome for blogging. It's open-sourced and has tons of free plugins and themes you can play with. 
Hey, even the nuSchool blog is built with WordPress! (Also: Adobe blogs, Huffington Post, TED, CNN, TIME, UPS.....)


## SASS

## Misc

- FR£€? As in free account on FB, or freedom of information?

## Planning

This [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/lMmuSlkP/public-design-sprint-template) breaks down the five phases of a design sprint. More on this [here](http://www.gv.com/lib/gimlet)

# The future

### Gamifying the grading 

* Everyone starts from an F and can walk their way up to A
* Continuous micro-assessment, not just at the end of a unit
* Rigorous assessment criteria, shared with everyone from the beginning
* Shared leaderboard
* Teacher as a coach (rather than a judge)
* Peer-assessment to offer different perspectives and opportunities to reflect
