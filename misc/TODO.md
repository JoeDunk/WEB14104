# Term 3

It's not enough to coast along and settle on the first (or second) design.

I believe that you can all do better and I want to help you improve. 

I don't want to be marking work that it's just *ok*. 

So far we've been quite gentle at you but we're going to accellerate and it's going to get harder.

You need to work harder and challenge yourselves.

You're paying a lot to be here. Imagine yourself in a few years time, looking back at what you have done (or not) at uni. 

Now it's your opportunity to experiment, to explore and soak up all the knowledge and skills from all the people that are around you here.

## WP

From Gutenberg (printing revolution) to Zuckerberg (social media "revolution"), passing by WordPress (blogging revolution: everyone can be a publisher)

Jargon Buster: API, SPA, REST...

SPA (Single Page Application) vs page reload: Using the API has a performance benefit: static HTML pages with JS to fetch the data is a thing! No PHP dependency.

WordPress is one of the best platforms out there for creating a website. It's super awesome for blogging. It's open-sourced and has tons of free plugins and themes you can play with. 
Hey, even the nuSchool blog is built with WordPress! (Also: Adobe blogs, Huffington Post, TED, CNN, TIME, UPS.....)
