# Programming on the server

### What's a server?

Just a computer that is **always on**, **connected** to the Internet and ready to accept **HTTP requests** and serve documents (HTML, CSS, JS, images etc) in **response**.

### Can I run a WebServer on my computer?

Yes!

[WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/#wampserver-64-bits-php-5-3) is for Windows, [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en) is for Mac (well, now for Win too), [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) is for both (+ Linux)

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) + [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

### Meet PHP

When we develop for the browser (*front-end*), there is only one programming language available to us: Javascript. 
On the *back-end* or **server-side** we can choose whichever language we want.

[PHP](http://php.net) is a popular programming language for Web servers, because it underpins websites like WordPress and Facebook, but also because it has been around a long time.
