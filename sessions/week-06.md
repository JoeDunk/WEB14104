# Wireframes review

When you review wireframes, ask yourself (or your buddy designers):

* Is anything important missing from this page?
* Is the most important content the first thing you notice?
* Is there anything on this page that shouldn't be there?
* Which content is related and how?
* Can you get to all of the major sections of the site from here? Should you be able to?
* Do all of the labels make sense?
* Do you know what all of the elements on this page are?
