3. Let's *critique* each other's work

### Leading questions

* Is anything important missing from this page?
* Is the most important content the first thing you notice?
* Is there anything on this page that shouldn't be there?
* Do you know what all of the elements on this page are?
* Can you get to all of the major sections of the site from here? Should you be able to?
* Do all of the labels make sense?

### Critiquette

All comments must be `KASH`:

* **Kind** 
	
	Focus on the work. No sarcasm or personal comments. 
	
	Your comments can be challenging but the creator of the work should feel that your feedback is work-oriented and happy to receive it.
	
* **Actionable**	
	
	Your comments should include suggestions or instructions, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.
	
* **Specific** 

	Don't just state `It's (not) good` or `I (don't) like it`. Explain why.
	
	Comment on specific aspects or details of the work, eg: `Navigation labels are unconventional but I wonder if most people would get what they stand for..`
	
* **Helpful** 

	If it doesn't benefit the work, the learning, the learner or the class, don't share it

In a nutshell:
 
> Be hard on content and soft on people!
