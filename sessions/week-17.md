# Presentation checklist

Next week you'll have **10 minutes** each to 

1. Present your project and process `~6 minutes`
2. Q&A `~4 minutes`


This is a list of topics that your presentation *should* touch upon. 

* The **context**
	* What is the *subject* of your project? 
	* What is the *challenge* (or challenges) that it currently presents?
	* What is the *opportunity* (or opportunities) that emerge from the challenge(s)?
	
	It's very important to start your presentation with the definition of a **context**. If you don't do this, feedback could quickly turn into a critique of your mockups instead of your **solution**. After all, itâ€™s much easier to have an opinion on font sizes and colour choices than on the strategy of a product.
	
* Your **goal**
	* *Why* are you working on this?
	* How can you take this project further *beyond this unit*?
	* What have you *learned*? What did you enjoy? What did you find most challenging? 

* Your **research**	
	* The *bad* website you chose. [Why is it bad?](week-02.md#blog) Why does it not work? Why does it not meet its audience's needs?
	* [Moodboard](week-04.md#homework)
	* [Webdesign myths](week-07.md#blog)

* Your **process**
	* [Paper sketches](week-05.md#sketch-out-your-ideas-on-paper)
	* [Digital wireframes](week-06.md#redraft-your-wireframes)
	* [HTML + CSS wireframes](week-11.md#homework)
	* [Wordpress templates](week-14.md#template)
	* The website as it currently stands on the WWW
	
	Tell us a **story**, not a features list. 
	
	We want to know how your idea *evolved*, from its inception up to its current state, and what you learned in the process.

Your presentation doesn't have to strictly follow the same order in which things are outlined here. **Structure your presentation as it makes sense to you**. Remember, we do value creativity after all ;)
