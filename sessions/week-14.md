# Pimp your WordPress

![](assets/beetle.jpg)

You can turn a basic WP site into many different things

![](assets/big-beetle.png)

![](assets/bat-beetle.jpg)

**Plugins** you should install:

* [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) lets you create your own data fields to make your content flexible. 
 	
 	![](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/wp-content/themes/acf/assets/images/home-box-fields.png)
 	
 	You can customise your pages and posts with over 20 field types: text, textarea, wysiwyg, image, file, page link, post object, relationship, select, checkbox, radio buttons, date picker, true / false, repeater, flexible content, gallery and more
 	
 	[Repeater Field](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/repeater-field/) is also very useful (not free, but worth the little fee if you're building a site for clients, or even for yourself, or friends)

* [Post Tags and Categories for Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-tags-and-categories-for-pages/) allows you to organise your pages with categories and tags (by default only for posts)
 
* [Duplicate Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/) lets you quickly *clone* a post or page

* [WP Sync DB](https://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db) lets you push, pull, and sync database tables between WordPress sites (eg between your local WP and your client's hosted site)

* [WordPress SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) helps you write *better* content and optimise it for search engines (SEO = Search Engine Optimisation)

* Any other plugins you recommend?

### Your turn

1. I'll show you how to create *Advanced Custom Fields* for one page 
2. Pick a page from the site you're designing, work out its **content sections**, eg: name, images, ingredients, method, serving suggestions, dietary requirements 
3. Using *Advanced Custom Fields*, create fields for the content sections of your chosen page
