# Getting pages laid out

> Laying out content using CSS is easy. You chop your page up and shove the chunks wherever you please...

To become a skilled *CSS bricklayer*, there are only two properties that you should really learn

* `position` (see the [docs on WebPlatform](https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/position))
* `float` (see the [docs on WebPlatform](https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/float))

### Position

<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<iframe height='350' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/baddeo/embed/OPxJLP/' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/baddeo/pen/OPxJLP/'>CSS position 101</a> by Matteo Menapace (<a href='http://codepen.io/baddeo'>@baddeo</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.

* `static` is the default value. 

	Static elements just sit in the normal HTML flow.
	
	There is rarely a need to set this value unless the element has been set with another matching selector to a different value and you need to set it back.
	
* `relative` is similar to `static` but the box can be offset from its original position with the properties `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left`.
 
* `absolute` pulls a box out of the normal flow of the HTML and delivers it to a world all of its own. In this crazy little world, the absolute box can be placed anywhere on the page using top, right, bottom and left.

* `fixed` behaves like `absolute`, but it will absolutely position a box in reference to the browser window as opposed to the web page, so fixed boxes should stay exactly where they are on the screen even when the page is scrolled.

### Float

static, relative, absolute, fixed

Hipsteer-like example?
