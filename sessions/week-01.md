# Draw *the Web*!	

> But what do you mean by *the Web*? 

* Imagine you have to **explain** what the Web is to an alien, or to your grandma. 

* No need to make a technical drawing. It's more interesting (and more fun) if you **draw what the Web means to you** *personally*. 

* You have ~30 minutes to **sketch your idea** out.

* Then each *artist* will present their piece to the class, and together we discuss emerging **themes**  and **metaphors/symbols** 

<!--(globe/planet, connections, computers, brands)-->

<!--(clouds, trees, cats)-->
	
# How does it WWWork?

One of the emerging themes from your drawings *should* be that the WWW is a **Web of interlinked knowledge**, in constant evolution.

To put this concept into practice, let's pretend that each one of us is a `node` in a `network` of knowledge. Each node will hold information about a certain concept related to the WWW (for example: DNS, HTTP, IP address etc). 


[Using this collaborative Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NrRUySCy8CUf7Wrc4cbjwxsWh_fk6jXs47oMCnEljLk/edit?usp=sharing	) **research one key Web concept** and then explain it to your classmates. 

1. Each student picks (or is assigned) one concept.

2. You'll have about 1 hour to research. 
 
 	Collect links and jot down your notes about your chosen concept. 
 	
 	Make sure you **reference your sources** of information. For instance, don't just copy-paste from WikiPedia. Instead, include a link to the WikiPedia article where your text comes from.

3. Then 5 minutes to explain (~1 hour in total)
