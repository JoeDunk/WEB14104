# Checklist for presentations

1. [HTML + CSS recipe documentation](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/blob/master/sessions/week-05.md#1-document-your-recipes-evolution) 

	* What have you learned? 
	* What do you want to learn?

2. The bad website you chose. [Why is it bad?](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/blob/master/sessions/week-02.md#assignment-for-next-week)

	Your analysis should refer to [these principles](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/blob/master/sessions/week-02.md#what-makes-a-website-bad) (aka *heuristics*). 
	
	Let's not just talk about visual design (aesthetics), but **focus on functionality** first. 
	
	The websites you chose are not art pieces to be admired / interpreted, but rather tools used by people to achieve some practical goal(s). So the main question your analysis must answer is
	
	> Why does this website not work?

3. [Moodboard](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/blob/master/sessions/week-04.md#assignment)

4. **Wireframes** at different stages: 

	* [paper sketches](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/blob/master/sessions/week-05.md#2-sketch-out-your-ideas-on-paper) for alternative solutions 
	* [digital wireframes](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/blob/master/sessions/week-06.md#1-redraft-your-wireframes)
	* BONUS: clickable wireframes (HTML + CSS or InVision)
