Formative Assessment presentations

Your [homework](#homework)!


# Checklist for presentations

1. [HTML + CSS recipe documentation](week-05.md#1-document-your-recipes-evolution) 

	* What have you learned? 
	* What do you want to learn?

2. The bad website you chose. [Why is it bad?](week-02.md#assignment-for-next-week)

	Your analysis should refer to [these principles](week-02.md#what-makes-a-website-bad) (aka *heuristics*). 
	
	Let's not just talk about visual design (aesthetics), but **focus on functionality** first. 
	
	The websites you chose are not art pieces to be admired / interpreted, but rather tools used by people to achieve some practical goal(s). So the main question your analysis must answer is
	
	> Why does this website not work?

3. [Moodboard](week-04.md#assignment)

4. **Wireframes** at different stages: 

	* [paper sketches](week-05.md#2-sketch-out-your-ideas-on-paper) for alternative solutions 
	* [digital wireframes](week-06.md#1-redraft-your-wireframes)
	* BONUS: clickable wireframes (HTML + CSS or InVision)
	
5. How do you intend to take your project forward?
