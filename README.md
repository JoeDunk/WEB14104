# Web Development Workshop

### [bit.ly/WEB14104](http://bit.ly/WEB14104)

This unit introduces you to the concepts, methods and tools used to produce Web sites that are technically sound, aesthetically cohesive and appropriately structured.

This includes:

* technical overview of the **WWW**
* structuring content with **MarkDown** and **HTML**
* organising projects with **Git**
* styling pages with **CSS**
* making pages dynamic with **PHP**
* using **WordPress** to manage online content  
* developing **WordPress templates and themes**
* buying a **domain** 
* **hosting** a website
* transferring files with **FTP**
* **project management** basics: listing and prioritising tasks, tracking and evaluating progress, getting things done

Using individual practical projects, you will research, conceptualise and prototype a Web site re-design. 



# Brief

Pick one *bad* website and re-design it.

Your re-designed version must 

* be **online** (not just on your computer)
* be **dynamic** (update-able via a CMS) 
* be **responsive** (adapting to different screen sizes)
* be **accessible** (for people with disabilities and limited devices)
* be visually **cohesive** and coherent
* have **appropriately structured** information
* have a style informed by (but not necessarily following) contemporary trends

# Assessment criteria

Your final mark will be based on:

* [80% project](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104#project)
* [20% blog](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104#blog)


## Project

### Components

1. **Research**: *analysis* of bad websites and *mood board*
* **Interface design**: experimentation and testing of ideas through *wireframes* at various stages, from paper to digital
* **Front-end code**: responsive, cohesive and appropriately structured *HTML & CSS* (bonus: JavaScript); includes recipe mini-project
* **Back-end code**: accessible and dynamic web-pages served via *WordPress* (bonus: plugins) 
* **Workflow**: all your project files on *GitHub* (bonus: action plan)

### Grades

#### F

[M.I.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action) The student failed to deliver the assignment. 

#### E

* **Research**: either analysis or moodboard are missing
* **Interface design**: wireframes for only a couple of pages, using filler content (*Lorem ipsum*, no images)
* **Front-end code**: it has major bugs or is incomplete to a point that is impossible to get a clear idea of the user experience
* **Back-end code**: it has major bugs or is incomplete to a point that is impossible to get a clear idea of the user experience
* **Workflow**: dumped files with no clear folders structure and/or bad naming (*untitled folder* and the likes), sparse commits

#### D

* **Research**: disorganised or subjective, didn't use the suggested methods
* **Interface design**: wireframes for only a couple of pages, using real(istic) content
* **Front-end code**: it is functional but not responsive or appropriately structured
* **Back-end code**: it has some bugs but it is possible to get a glimpse of the user experience
* **Workflow**: sparse *end-of-day-dump* commits

#### C

* **Research**: demonstrates use of suggested methods but it is superficial or unfocused
* **Interface design**: wireframed 50%+ of page templates, using real(istic) content
* **Front-end code**: it is appropriately structured but not responsive (or viceversa) 
* **Back-end code**: it is functional (no bugs)
* **Workflow**: sparse yet meaningful commits (specific to tasks, descriptive messages) 

#### B

* **Research**: demonstrates use of suggested methods, explanations are informed by examples and other evidence
* **Interface design**: wireframed all page templates, using real(istic) content; demonstration of several iterations of ideas
* **Front-end code**: it is appropriately structured and responsive
* **Back-end code**: it is functional at its core, attempts to add extra features (eg: plugins)
* **Workflow**: frequent and meaningful commits

#### A

* **Research**: demonstrates use of suggested methods, providing lots of links and attributions of ideas, as well as visuals to illustrate concepts; extensive market research
* **Interface design**: wireframed all page templates, using real(istic) content; demonstration of several iterations of ideas  with evidence of user-testing
* **Front-end code**: it is appropriately structured, responsive and progressively enhanced (JavaScript may be used but not a necessity) + comments
* **Back-end code**: it is functional at its core, succesfully added extra features
* **Workflow**: frequent and meaningful commits + action plan
