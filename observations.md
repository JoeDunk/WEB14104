# Session 1

* Intro: would be good to base the conversation around the **assessment criteria**, and show concrete examples of students work with marks.

* **Draw the Web** is fun, everyone apart from ON enjoyed it. Also interesting conversation afterwards, which leads well into the next research task.

* **Research** on Google Doc worked well, need to force people to reference their sources.

* Collaborative research and discussion on *How does it WWWork* went quite well.
To make it more **playful** and keep people's *antennas* up, we could introduce a *ball* (or any other soft object that can be easily and safely thrown around.. idea from Angela Morelli, Science Museum 2011). Only who has the *ball* can speak, and whwnever s/he mentions a keyword that belongs to someone else, they need to pass it to them and let them talk a bit.

* [ ] Discussion around key WWW concepts: could experiment with an object that needs to be passed/thrown to the person who's in charge of a concept you mentioned. 
 

# Session 2

* [ ] Learning goals review in small groups went well I think. Maybe experiment with jotting down common goals on a whiteboard?

* Semiotics leading into MD: students interested but could go a bit quicker. Ask more questions.

- [ ] MD and GitHub: who else is using it? Make it **relevant**.

- [ ] MD: focus on writing rather than making it look good, or adding spaces between things?

* GitHub: more efficient to add people to a team and then add the whole team as **collaborators** in the repo

* [ ] Fork or branch? See below.

* [ ] Git: need to explain the difference between clone, fork, push and pull. Maybe with a **Git quiz**?

* **What makes a website bad?**: try it as a group exercise. Maybe assign each group a couple of principles to concentrate on? 


# Session 3

* **Separation of concerns** seemed to go down well, mostly because of the BBC example than the royal paper dolls.

* **Quiz time** was the most successful activity of the day, in terms of students attention, as everybody participated quite actively. The quiz sparked a few interesting questions too.

* **HTML recipe**: short and focused exercise, gave me the opportunity to compare solutions and highlight good / bad practices.  

* The XML sandwich confused a couple of students. Maybe I should have asked *Is this sandwich valid HTML* as part of the quiz? 
 
* Most people seem uninterested in analysing bad websites or using heuristics (too abstract?) In general they seem to want me to teach them *how to make cool Web things*. Practical knowledge, **no theory plz**. 

* Introduced **alternative brief**: *design a website for the Ravensbourne Web Media course*. I feel that this would be an easier, more relatable subject for students to work on. Also giving them the same subject could create a common ground for ideas and maybe foster a healthy competition?

* Had to show **how Git works** again. Which is fine, need to remember that this workflow is not easy, many people don't seem to grasp how folders and files really work, or how to save files with the right extension. So it's worth demonstrating how to save an html file and commit-push it to GitHub.

* Should I have a **student alter ego** to push stuff to? 

* GTD video captured most people's attention. **Buzzwords bingo** not sure, need to experiment more with it, maybe base the discussion around the buzzwords. In general, need to get better at **moderating discussions**.  


# Session 4

### HTML and CSS boilerplates?

* folder structure, naming shit
* HTML comments
* CSS comments
* CSS reset / normalize
* CSS scaffolding `max-width` and `margin`

### Moodboard

Give it a chiecklist of components, eg:

* inspiring competitors (screenshots of entire pages)
* inspiring details (screenshots)
* colours
* imagery
* typography
* current state of affairs
* possible directions


# Session 5

* **Folder structure** and how to `<link` files. Don't take it for granted. Can be part of the quiz

### Grids

* Show **examples** from [960GS](http://960.gs) to demonstrate how grid systems are used by real websites.. and also big sites like The Guardian, Time etc.

* Show badly aligned code and **well indented code**, to demonstrate how grids are useful to make information easy to read / scan

* **LDN vs NYC** map: which one is easier to navigate?

* Maybe GridLover should be done on the previous session, before people start writing their recipe's CSS?

### Recipe demo

> In-greedy-ants

Used Skeleton to quickly demo how to lay out a recipe using a grid. [Here's the code](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/tree/master/sessions/skeleton-recipe).

I think it makes sense to do a live-demo for people to follow along and ask questions.

Maybe have some content ready, like a list of ingredients to plonk in as a `<ul>` and the method.  

### Policing

* Low **turnout**, again. What can we do about it?

* People getting **distracted by phones**.. should we start confiscating them? 

### Writing

* People struggle to **articulate** their ideas.. they say things like *I want to make this site look better* or *I want to make this look more basic and easier to navigate*. See [this example](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/Moodboard.jpg). 

* People don't **edit** what they write. See [this example](https://github.com/jackkemmish/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Jack/Bad%20Websites/the_bad_website%20chosen%20one.md). There are sweeping **assumptions** like *it can be made more interesting by adding a better structure to the lay out* (what structure? how better? what is the lay out?)

- [ ] Maybe show some stream of consciusness stuff.. some badly written text and ask them to re-write it?

# Briefs

## From `redesign a bad website` to `uglify a good website`? 

See [this essay](http://vcu.sagepub.com/content/13/3/314.full.pdf+html) 

> Internet Ugly is an imposition of messy humanity upon an online world of smooth gradients, blemish-correcting Photoshop, and AutoCorrect. It exploits tools meant to smooth and beautify, using them to muss and distort.
