# Session 1

* Intro: would be good to base the conversation around the **assessment criteria**, and show concrete examples of students work with marks.

* **Draw the Web** is fun, everyone apart from ON enjoyed it. Also interesting conversation afterwards, which leads well into the next research task.

* **Research** on Google Doc worked well, need to force people to reference their sources.

* [ ] Discussion around key WWW concepts: could experiment with an object that needs to be passed/thrown to the person who's in charge of a concept you mentioned. 
 

# Session 2

* [ ] Learning goals review in small groups went well I think. Maybe experiment with jotting down common goals on a whiteboard?

* Semiotics leading into MD: students interested but could go a bit quicker. Ask more questions.

- [ ] MD and GitHub: who else is using it? Make it **relevant**.

- [ ] MD: focus on writing rather than making it look good, or adding spaces between things?

* GitHub: more efficient to add people to a team and then add the whole team as **collaborators** in the repo

* [ ] Fork or branch? See below.

* [ ] Git: need to explain the difference between clone, fork, push and pull. Maybe with a **Git quiz**?

* **What makes a website bad?**: try it as a group exercise. Maybe assign each group a couple of principles to concentrate on? 


# Session 3

* **Separation of concerns** seemed to go down well, mostly because of the BBC example than the royal paper dolls.

* **Quiz time** was the most successful activity of the day, in terms of students attention, as everybody participated quite actively. The quiz sparked a few interesting questions too.

* **HTML recipe**: short and focused exercise, gave me the opportunity to compare solutions and highlight good / bad practices.  

* The XML sandwich confused a couple of students. Maybe I should have asked *Is this sandwich valid HTML* as part of the quiz? 
 
* Most people seem uninterested in analysing bad websites or using heuristics (too abstract?) In general they seem to want me to teach them *how to make cool Web things*. Practical knowledge, **no theory plz**. 

* Introduced **alternative brief**: *design a website for the Ravensbourne Web Media course*. I feel that this would be an easier, more relatable subject for students to work on. Also giving them the same subject could create a common ground for ideas and maybe foster a healthy competition?

* Had to show **how Git works** again. Which is fine, need to remember that this workflow is not easy, many people don't seem to grasp how folders and files really work, or how to save files with the right extension. So it's worth demonstrating how to save an html file and commit-push it to GitHub.

* Should I have a **student alter ego** to push stuff to? 

* GTD video captured most people's attention. **Buzzwords bingo** not sure, need to experiment more with it, maybe base the discussion around the buzzwords. In general, need to get better at **moderating discussions**.
